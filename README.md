Nonogram Puzzles (aka Picross, Hanjie, and Griddlers) samples in JSON format.

## Overview of Nonogram puzzles

Nonogram puzzles are also called Picross, Hanjie, and Griddler puzzles.  These
are logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according 
to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture.   A good
introduction can be found on the the Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram).

These puzzles provide interesting exercises in solving problems for which brute force may not
be an answer.  For example, a single, black and white, length 20 row, with the clues "1 1 1 1"
has millions of possiblities.  Many nanogram solvers exist.

# Goals of this project

This project aspires to provide a free and easy to use set of Nonogram puzzles to test 
algorithms.  As consensus arises, the puzzles will also include difficulty rankings.

This project also hopes to be an exercise in Documentation Driven Development, where 
emphasis is on clear and concise documentation in advance of code.  Having practiced a
dozen different methods of developing code, I am experimenting with this method.  Granted,
this project will have little executable code.

# JSON Format

A JSON format file provides an easy way of importing a structured data.   More coming.
